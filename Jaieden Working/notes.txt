
Kinect Arduino - relative light bar so kinect and unity can +1, -3, etc.
		this also needs to return the current state. We'll call this arduino points. -- DONE

		Note: valid inputs are now:
			0 - -5
			1 - -4
			2 - -3
			3 - -2
			4 - -1
			5 -  0
			6 - +1
			7 - +2
			8 - +3
			9 - +4

Kinect - Reduce logic. Just add 1 arduino point every maxDuration/ledQuantity of sitting --DONE 

Unity - Trigger event on arduino stating it has zero points

Kinect - Address multiple people issue, only add the highest confidence to tracker

Kinect - Tracker is wiped whenever people are no longer detected in the frame, hoping the
	arduino points system will fix this
